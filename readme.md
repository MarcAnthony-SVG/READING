# Welcome to Blue Ocean

Congratulations and welcome to your first day at Blue Ocean! We are literally an underwater agile software development company.  

Let's begin our tour (don't blink!)...

## Your Agile Process

Expect this project to push you outside of your comfort zone. Welcome to your first day of life as a professional developer with a professional workflow.

During this project you will:
* Use Modern Agile Practices
* Use Modern Github Workflows
* Use Modern Development and Deployment Workflows

What does this mean tangibly? We are your new CEO, CTO, PM, and Product Owner. We expect you to build software meeting each of our standards over this next week.

During this time you will:
* Choose a project with the help of the team
* Create a backlog of tickets to work through during the week
* Participate in a Sprint Planning and a Sprint Retrospective
* Attend Daily Standup Meetings
* Meet Acceptance Criteria determined by the stakeholders
* Write tests and approve your teammates code through the peer review process
* Create a professional quality Github repo including a Readme, Test Coverage, and Clean Code

We're here to help guide you through this process...and potentially throw some wrenches in as well ;)

## Meetings and Expectations
#### Kickoff and Ideation
This is our meeting to discuss the project as a whole and go into the process. We'll walk through an IDEO-style ideation session, and work as a team to come up with a project that will satisfy the business needs of the org, as well as the problems of the Key Stakeholders. We want to walk out of this meeting with a clear project and a couple of high-level tickets written. 

#### Sprint Planning
During this meeting we will split into teams and flush out our technology choices. Afterwards, we will come together as a group to point tickets, break out chunks, and take on tickets. By the end of this meeting, the goal is to have a clearly defined scope of work, acceptance criteria, and initial tickets chosen.

#### Daily Standup
These will happen at 10AM daily. Each person will go in order, and tell the group:
1. What they worked on the previous day and if they have work that needs review
2. What they intend to work on today
3. If they are blocked by anything 
4. If they need to have a breakout with any individuals after standup for a specific question, blocker, or decision

#### User Testing & Acceptance
During this meeting your stakeholders will test your app to find bugs and areas that the work doesn't meet expectations. We will help to create some new tickets and point out areas for improvement (the team will participate in this too).

#### Sprint Review
The final piece of the puzzle. We will discuss what worked well, what didn't, areas for improvement, and where the project currently stands. The goal of this meeting is to leave with action items for the next iteration of the sprint both in terms of Process and the Product as a whole. 

After the sprint review, it will be up to *you* as a team to make sure that your Github Readme is well-written and your team's code is clean and well-tested. This will be your first impression for anyone wanting to look at the code you've written recently!

GOOD LUCK and HAVE FUN!
